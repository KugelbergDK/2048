## What is this game and how does it work? 
This game is about joining numbers and getting a number of 2048. 
The way it works is, you move the tiles with you arrows and they all move it to the side you pressed.<br>
For every move or join you make, there will be spawned a new tile with a 90% chance of getting a tile 2 and 10% chance of getting a tile 4.<br>
When you reach tile 2048, you have won. Very simple, yes. Join the numbers until you get the last tile.

### Example
You have following tiles on board:<br>
POS: X,Y

0,0 and value 2<br>
1,0 and value 2

If you press left or right, they will join together and the 2 tiles becomes to 1 with a value of 4. Now there is added 4 points to your score.
